# sql_magist_buiness_exploration
## summary
**Eniac** is a company that primarily deals with Apple-compatible accessories and is limited to Europe. They want to expand their sales in the Brazilian market. In Brazil, **Magist** offers a centralized order management system to connect small and medium-sized stores with the biggest Brazilian marketplaces.
## Languages and Libraries Used
We have used SQL to analyze our data and used Tableau for visualization.
## Key Learnings
I have primarily worked with SQL to explore the Magist data concerning Eniac's concerns. Eniac's main concern is whether Magist is a good fit for them and if deliveries are fast enough. So by exploring various factors such as _product category (Tech or Non-Tech)_, _Delivery status (if they provide delayed or on-time delivery)_, _Sellers (income, revenue)_  and developing correlations we have found out that Eniac concerns were further amplified as Magist is more inclined towards Non-Tech and have poor delivery status.  
## Challenges Overcame
As this was the first project I was doing so I felt a bit lost. I have no background knowledge as well so I struggled with everything at first and tried to explore, made mistakes but I also learned many things.
